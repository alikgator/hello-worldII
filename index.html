  <h2> Quotes </h2>
  <h3> The Tyger by William Blake </h3>
  <pre>
    
    Tyger Tyger, burning bright, 
    In the forests of the night; 
    What immortal hand or eye, 
    Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
  </pre>
  <p>
    The blockquote does not seem to work besides the fact that it is indented. I does not preserve the line-oriented text and I can't see any difference between the paragraph and the blocquote in the rendering of the webpage. </p>

  <blockquote>
    Ok, the preceding text is inside the <code> &lt;p&gt; </code> tag and this one is a blockquote. I can see that the blocquote is indented. Lets see now it it indents also on the right side. Nope.
